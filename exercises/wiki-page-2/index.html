                The role of the <a href="graphic designer">graphic Designer</a> in the communication process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses the <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a> of <a href="typography">typography</a> and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup>

                <a href="William Addison Dwiggins">William Addison Dwiggins</a> is often credited with first using the term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,<a href="[14]"><sup>[14]</sup></a> although it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of <i>Organized Labor</i>, a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about technical education for printers:<a href="[15]"><sup>[15]</sup></a>

                In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of <a href="visual communication">visual communication</a> in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, <a href="languages">languages</a> and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human experience."<a href="[17]"><sup>[17]</sup></a>

        <h4>The advent of printing</h4>

                In China, during the <a href="Tang dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> (618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts.

            A graphic design project may involve the creative presentation of existing <a href="text">text</a>, ornament, and images.The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.<a href="[citation needed]"><sup>[citation needed]</sup></a>

        <h4>Typography</h4>
            <p>
                Typography includes type design, modifying type <a href="glyphs">glyphs</a> and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).

        <h4>Page layout</h4>
            <p>
                Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of <a href="type">type</a> (text), <a href="images">images</a> (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a <a href="dieline">dieline</a> for elements that are not printed with ink such as <a href="die/laser cutting">die/laser cutting</a>,<a href="foil stamping">foil stamping</a> or <a href="blind embossing">blind embossing</a>.
            </p>
        <h4>Grids</h4>
            <p>
                A grid serves as a method of arranging both space and information, allowing the reader to easily comprehend the overall project. Furthermore, a grid functions as a container for information and a means of establishing and maintaining order. Despite grids being utilized for centuries, many graphic designers associate them with Swiss design. The desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a highly systematic approach to visualizing information. However, grids were later regarded as tedious and uninteresting, earning the label of "designersaur." Today, grids are once again considered crucial tools for professionals, whether they are novices or veterans.<a href="[36]"><sup>[36]</sup></a>
