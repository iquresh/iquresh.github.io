                            Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG, featuring a persistent world where players can interact with each other and the environment. Players create and customize their characters for use in the game, including name, race, gender, facial features, and starting class. Unlike in the original release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting classâ€”Disciples of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable. Players must also select a game server for each character.

                            PC and home console versions use a unified user interface and control scheme. Any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and game controller may be used; for console players, wireless or USB keyboard and mouse are required for the former.

                            Players improve their characters by gaining experience points (EXP) and acquiring stronger equipment. After gaining enough XP, the character will "level up," improving their statistics, enhancing the character's performance and often learning new actions. Primary sources of experience points in Final Fantasy XIV include completing quests, exploring instanced dungeons, participating in Full Active Time Events (FATEs), and slaying monsters in the world.[7]

                            Final Fantasy XIV is set on Hydaelyn, a fictional world of diverse environments across three main continents, focused on the region of Eorzea.[22] Four major city-states are featured: Gridania, in the heavily-forested Black Shroud; Ul'dah, a trade-centric sultanate in arid Thanalan; Limsa Lominsa, a thalassocracy found on the island of Vylbrand; and Ishgard, an isolationist theocracy in snowy, mountainous Coerthas. Eastward, a land bridge connects eastern Eorzea to the other main continents, conquered by the Garlean Empire.

                            The player character is an Eorzean adventurer during the Seventh Umbral Era who joins one of the three Grand Companies: Gridania's Order of the Twin Adder under Elder Seedseer Kan-E-Senna; Ul'dah's Immortal Flames, under Flame General Raubahn Aldynn; and the Maelstrom of Limsa Lominsa under Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn.[31] Their allies include Minfilia and her Scions of the Seventh Dawn, the unified remnants of two supporting organizations from the Sixth Astral Era, Louisoix's Circle of Knowing and Minfilia's Path of the Twelve.[32]
