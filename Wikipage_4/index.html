            Gemini (♊︎) (/ˈdʒɛmɪnaɪ/ JEM-in-eye,[2] Greek: Δίδυμοι, romanized: Dídymoi, Latin for "twins") is the third astrological sign in the zodiac. Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this sign between about May 21 to June 21.[3] Gemini is represented by the twins, Castor and Pollux,[4] known as the Dioscuri in Greek mythology. It is a positive, mutable sign.

        <p>
            In Babylonian astronomy, the stars Pollux and Castor were known as the Great Twins. Their names were Lugal-irra and Meslamta-ea, meaning "The Mighty King" and "The One who has arisen from the Underworld". Both names are titles of Nergal, a major Babylonian god of plague and pestilence, who was king of the underworld.[5]
