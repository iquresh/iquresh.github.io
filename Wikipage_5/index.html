        <h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Inattention, hyperactivity (restlessness in adults), disruptive behaviour, and impulsivity are common in ADHD.[36][37] Academic difficulties are frequent as are problems with relationships.[36] The symptoms can be difficult to define, as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin.[38] 
        </p>
        <h3>Subtypes</h3>
        <p>ADHD is divided into three primary presentations:<a href="[4][38]">[4][38]</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="predominantly inattentive">predominantly inattentive</a> (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I)</li>
            <li>predominantly hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-PH or ADHD-HI)</li>
            <li>combined type (ADHD-C).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Comorbidities</h3>
        <h4>Psychiatric</h4>
        <p>
            In children, ADHD occurs with other disorders about two-thirds of the time. Other neurodevelopmental conditions are common comorbidities. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), co-occurring at a rate of 21% in those with ADHD, affects social skills, ability to communicate, behaviour, and interests.[51][52] Both ADHD and ASD can be diagnosed in the same person.[4] Learning disabilities have been found to occur in about 20–30% of children with ADHD. Learning disabilities can include developmental speech and language disorders, and academic skills disorders.[53] ADHD, however, is not considered a learning disability, but it very frequently causes academic difficulties.[53] Intellectual disabilities[4] and Tourette's syndrome[52] are also common.
        </p>
        <h4>Trauma</h4>
        <p>
            ADHD, trauma, and Adverse Childhood Experiences are also comorbid,[72][73][74] which could in part be potentially explained by the similarity in presentation between different diagnoses. The symptoms of ADHD and PTSD can have significant behavioural overlap—in particular, motor restlessness, difficulty concentrating, distractibility, irritability/anger, emotional constriction or dysregulation, poor impulse control, and forgetfulness are common in both.[72][75][76] This could result in trauma-related disorders or ADHD being mis-identified as the other.[75] Additionally, traumatic events in childhood are a risk factor for ADHD[77][78] - it can lead to structural brain changes and the development of ADHD behaviours.[75] Finally, the behavioural consequences of ADHD symptoms cause a higher chance of the individual experiencing trauma (and therefore ADHD leads to a concrete diagnosis of a trauma-related disorder).[79][non-primary source needed]
        </p>
        <h4>Non-psychiatric</h4>
        <p>
            Some non-psychiatric conditions are also comorbidities of ADHD. This includes epilepsy,[52] a neurological condition characterised by recurrent seizures.[80][81] There are well established associations between ADHD and obesity,[82] asthma[82] and sleep disorders,[82] and an association with celiac disease.[83] Children with ADHD have a higher risk for migraine headaches,[84] but have no increased risk of tension-type headaches.[85][86] In addition, children with ADHD may also experience headaches as a result of medication.[85][86]
        </p>
        <h3>Suicide risk</h3>
        <p>
            Systematic reviews conducted in 2017 and 2020 found strong evidence that ADHD is associated with increased suicide risk across all age groups, as well as growing evidence that an ADHD diagnosis in childhood or adolescence represents a significant future suicidal risk factor.[88][89] Potential causes include ADHD's association with functional impairment, negative social, educational and occupational outcomes, and financial distress.[90][91]
        </p>
        <h3>IQ test performance</h3>
        <p>
            Certain studies have found that people with ADHD tend to have lower scores on intelligence quotient (IQ) tests.[92] The significance of this is controversial due to the differences between people with ADHD and the difficulty determining the influence of symptoms, such as distractibility, on lower scores rather than intellectual capacity.[92] In studies of ADHD, higher IQs may be over-represented because many studies exclude individuals who have lower IQs despite those with ADHD scoring on average nine points lower on standardised intelligence measures.[93] In individuals with high intelligence, there is increased risk of a missed ADHD diagnosis, possibly because of compensatory strategies in highly intelligent individuals.[94]

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Genetics</h3>
        <p>
            ADHD has a high heritability of 74%, meaning that 74% of the presence of ADHD in the population is due to genetic factors.[99] There are multiple gene variants which each slightly increase the likelihood of a person having ADHD; it is polygenic and arises through the combination of many gene variants which each have a small effect.[99][100] The siblings of children with ADHD are three to four times more likely to develop the disorder than siblings of children without the disorder.[101]
        </p>
        <h3>Environment</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to genetics, some environmental factors might play a role in causing ADHD.[111][112] Alcohol intake during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders which can include ADHD or symptoms like it.[113] Children exposed to certain toxic substances, such as lead or polychlorinated biphenyls, may develop problems which resemble ADHD.[13][114] Exposure to the organophosphate insecticides chlorpyrifos and dialkyl phosphate is associated with an increased risk; however, the evidence is not conclusive.[115] Exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy can cause problems with central nervous system development and can increase the risk of ADHD.[13][116] Nicotine exposure during pregnancy may be an environmental risk.[117]
        </p>
        <h3>Society</h3>
        <p>
            The youngest children in a class have been found to be more likely to be diagnosed as having ADHD, possibly due to them being developmentally behind their older classmates.[127][128] They also appear to use ADHD medications at nearly twice the rate of their peers.[129]
